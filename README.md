# time_tell_telegram_bot
A simple Telegram bot which greets us and tells the time when we ask for the time.

Jut create a api token from @botfather bot on telegram and create a file named constants.py and write this in the file:
API_KEY = '//paste the api here, in this string'

greet our bot by saying 'hello', 'hi' and ask for the time by typing 'time' or 'time?'


Thank you!
